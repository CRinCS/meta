For planning projects etc. 
We'll probably make a new repo for each project, so this repo is for planning, and maybe hosting a website etc.

The goal is to find cool results that don't have openly available code and replicate them, in a way that means that they could be easily tweaked, built upon and/or used as teaching materials. It also gives us an opportunity to go _"hang on! There's an issue here, we don't get the same results! What's going on!?"_ and it seems like a good idea to make room for those opportunities in science.
We could submit them to [The ReScience Journal](https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience) to get them out into the world and to get some academic brownie points (publications and citations).

### Projects that would be cool to replicate (in no order, based solely on DG's personal interest)

- [Barrionuevo & Cao (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.31.00A131) ([in progress](https://github.com/da5nsy/BarrionuevoCao_Reproduction) - need to think about transferring that to this org).
- [Ruderman, Cronin, & Chiao (1998)](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.15.002036) (DG has the data, need to check if it's OK to share it)
- [Maloney & Wandell (1986)](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.3.000029)
- [Yendrikhovskij (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1002/1520-6378(2001)26:1+<::AID-COL50>3.0.CO;2-O)

Suggestions welcome... (https://github.com/CRinCS/meta/issues/1)
